        <h1>List of sexualities I've used</h1>
        <p>Surprisingly, I've never used straight.<br><br>
            Asexual: No feelings of sexual attraction.<br>
            Aromatic: No feelings of romantic attraction.<br>
            Demisexual: Sexual attraction comes with emotional attachment. Demi people often fall for close friends.<br>
            Gay/Lesbian/Homosexual: Sexual attraction to people of the gender you identify as. It's important to note that homosexuality is more than girls liking girls and guys liking guys; two nonbinary-agender people liking each other would be homosexuality. <span style="color: black; font-size:90%;">I may have made a pact with the Yuri Demon, as most of my characters are lesbians</span><br>
